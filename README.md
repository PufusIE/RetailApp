# About this project and Planning   
My plan for this project is to build a retail application for a store with:  

Desktop UI for cashiers  
Web UI for administrators and managers  
And separate data access with API  

  

I plan to build a .NET Framework based project and then Upgrade it to .NET Core   
  
# Progress
I built the first Iteration on .Net Framework using token based authentication and implemented role strict endpoints.
Now I successfully upgraded my application to .Net Core 6, including WPF, ASP.NET and all my libraries.
  
I also implemented JWT Token based authentication and MVVM structure in my WPF project.  
  
# Dependencies
This application features N-Tier Data Architecture.  
Example of dependency structure: 

[ ASP.NET Api ] => [ Api Library ] => [ SQL Database ]

[ WPF.Core ] => [ WPF Library ] => [ SQL Database ]
