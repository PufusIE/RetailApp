Application Ideas:
	* Actually interact with the inventory
	* A Xamarion Forms app for a mobile register
	* Web-based reporting
	* Blazor app
	* Microservices
	* Introduce a web-based inventory control system (Blazor?)

Phase 2 Roadmap
 1. Hook up inventory so it really increments/decrements
 2. Administrarive portal (web-based)
 3. Use Blazor WebAssembly PWA (pohone look on phones, web look on descktops)
 4. Dockerize backend (API, etc.)
 5. Breack off a piece as a microservice
