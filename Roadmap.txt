Application Ideas:
	* Actually interact with the inventory
	* Move the API to Azure
	* CI/CD process
	* Deploy the Desktop App to Blob Storage for download
	* Introduce a web-based inventory control system (Blazor? Possibly client side work?)
	* Web-based reporting
	* A Xamarion Forms app for a mobile register

Phase 2 Roadmap
 1. Take advantage of .Net Core 
 2. Set up a simple task board in Azure DevOps
 3. CI/CD with Azure DevOps (move source code to Azure DevOps?)
 4. Move the API to Azure
 5. Move the database to Azure SQL
 6. Deploy the desktop app to Azure Blob storage (file system)
 7. Web-based inventory control system
